<h1> SIEM Log Analysis Project </h1>

<h2> Project Overview </h2>

A SIEM setup using two virtual machines (VMs) (1 Ubuntu, 1 Linux Mint VM), a firewall (pfsense Community Edition), and an open source Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system called Wazuh. I built the project to practice my cybersecurity skills. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a744d57-bd42-48d6-95f8-26946c941f3f)
